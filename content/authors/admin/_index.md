About Me

I am a senior research scientist at [PAII Inc](http://www.paii-labs.com/). Before joining PAII in 2019, I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science from University of Texas at Arlington under supervision from Dr. Junzhou Huang. I hold both Master and Bachelor Degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University in China. My research interests include computer vision and machine learning with a focus on medical imaging applications with deep learning-based approaches.
